This project is a recreation of the C command called printf. It was a project that I selected from [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/).

With this project, you can recreate the commands that hand printf Flags, width, precision, and length, and type.

<b>Flags:</b>
+, -, 0, #, ' ' (space)

<b>Width and Percision</b>
Width is a number, and precision is a number that's seperated by a '.' from width.

<b>Lenght</b>
h, hh, l, ll, j, z

<b>Type</b>
s, c, i, d, x, u, o, p, C, S, D,X

Example of command to input in printf:
<b>ft_printf("%-0+5d", -42); </b>
